            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AFter I had determin'd to let the following Diſcourſe go abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, I never deliberated about the choice of a Patron, nor ſpent any time in conſidering to whom it ſhould be Dedicated.

I hope therefore, Madam, you'll not be diſpleas'd, if I preſent you the ſame again from the Preſs, <hi>a little enlarg'd.</hi> For it's
<pb facs="tcp:43789:3"/>obvious to apprehend, that theſe Papers, being now expos'd to the View of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, may eaſily fall into the hands of <hi>many</hi> Readers, who have not that <hi>Candour</hi> of <hi>Temper,</hi> that <hi>Quickneſs</hi> of <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,</hi> which every one admires in your Ladyſhip; and therefore it was adviſable, that I ſhould make what convenient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion I could, by a few Alterations and Additions, againſt Cavilling and miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And if, notwithſtanding all the care I have taken, the Work ſtill fall under Cenſure (and ſtrange indeed it muſt be, if it does not with ſome,) the ſevereſt Criticks, I doubt not, will however be ſo juſt, as to acknowledge that the <hi>Deſign,</hi> which is all your Ladyſhip is concern'd in, is good, and fit for a Perſon of Honour and Integrity to own; ſince it aim's at the vindicating the moſt Venerable Records of our Religion from the Objections, that are urg'd againſt their being Genuine. And whatever faults or defects there may be in the conduct thereof, for want of due Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Judgment in the undertaker, I don't in the leaſt deſire your Ladyſhip ſhould juſtify or defend, but leave them all to be charg'd on the account of,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>WHen I firſt drew up the</hi> Reflections <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Amyntor, <hi>that are here preſented to the</hi> Reader, (<hi>which was done above half a year ago, I though ſome</hi> Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>and</hi> Additions, <hi>have been made ſince, they were deſign'd only for the</hi> Cloſet <hi>of the</hi> Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lady, <hi>to whom they are</hi> Dedicated: <hi>For whoſe eaſe, the</hi> Quotations <hi>and</hi> References <hi>too, when the matter would bear it, were made in</hi> Engliſh. <hi>Theſe I have continued in the ſame Language ſtill, partly becauſe I ſuppoſe it will make them of more general uſe, and partly becauſe I think, that though the</hi> Diſcourſe <hi>be now Publiſh'd, yet the chief Right to it remains ſtill in the firſt</hi> Proprietor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Reader <hi>may perhaps enquire, why theſe Papers</hi> come out ſo late, <hi>and (it may be too) why they</hi> come out at all, <hi>ſince another has already Wrote upon the ſame</hi> Argument. <hi>To the</hi> Firſt <hi>I reply, that they were not originally intended for the</hi> Preſs, <hi>and therefore it is no wonder if it prov'd ſo long before they got thither. To the</hi> Second, <hi>all I have to ſay, is, That what I have here Written being ſeen by ſome Friends, for whom I have a great deference, they judg'd that</hi> it <hi>would have its uſe too, as well as the other Piece before-mention'd.
<pb facs="tcp:43789:4"/>To whoſe Judgment I ſubmitted, calling to mind that known Paſſage of a Learned Father,</hi> —
<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>St. Auguſt. of the Trinity l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> Every thing that is Written, does not fall into the hands of all Perſons. Perhaps ſome may meet with my Books, who may hear nothing of others, which have treated better of the ſame Subject. It is uſeful therefore that the ſame Queſtions ſhould be handled by ſeveral Perſons, after a different Method, though according to the Principles of the ſame Faith, that ſo the Explication of Difficulties and the Arguments for the Truth, may come to the knowledge of every one, either one way or other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And here I ſhould have taken my leave of the</hi> Reader <hi>for the preſent, and diſmiſs'd him to the Peruſal of the following</hi> Treatiſe <hi>(if he be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd) but that I think my ſelf oblig'd to take notice of two or three Paſſages in</hi> the Hiſtory of the Works of the Learned, <hi>for the Month of</hi> May, <hi>which contradict ſome Particulars that I have aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following</hi> Treatiſe. <hi>They are in the</hi> Account of the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of Mr. Baſnage, <hi>but to whom they are to be aſcrib'd, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not affirm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perhaps they may proceed from that</hi> Author, <hi>and perhaps they may be the miſtakes of thoſe who tranſmitted the account of his Work from</hi> Holland <hi>to our</hi> Engliſh Publiſhers. <hi>I charge them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directly upon no body, but finding them in the Book above-mention'd, ſhall give my Reaſons why I look upon them as Erroneous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I begin with</hi> p. 283, <hi>where we are told in the</hi> 2d. Paragraph, <hi>how</hi> Mr. B. demonſtrates that for three Ages after Chriſt, there was no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Canon; when both Private Perſons, and alſo Whole Churches, partly admitted Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious
<pb facs="tcp:43789:4"/>Books for Sacred, and partly deſpis'd the Genuine as Prophane. <hi>How far this aſſertion is deſign'd to extend, and what Mr.</hi> B. <hi>has done to confirm it, is no other ways Evident to me at preſent, then by the</hi> Argument, <hi>which is immediately ſubjoyn'd, to ſatisfy us of the Strength of the</hi> Demonſtration. <hi>This is intended to affect the Whole</hi> Bible, <hi>but I think a much lower Word then</hi> Demonſtration <hi>might have ſerv'd the turn, unleſs there be ſtronger Reaſons in reſerve. For it follows,</hi> —
<note n="†" place="bottom">How far the Ancients had any differences about the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> I have explain'd in its due place. my buſineſs here is to prove that <hi>Hermas</hi> was never eſteem'd part of it, or Canonical. And alſo to examine the Teſtimony of <hi>Theodorus</hi> concerning ſome Books of the <hi>Old.</hi>
               </note> So Origen believ'd that Hermas his Paſtor was a Book Divinely inſpir'd. On the contrary Theodorus of Mopſueſtia calls the Book of Job a Fable borrowed from Paganiſm; the Books of Chronicles and Eſdras a vain Rhapſody; the Song of Solomon a Love Song, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have here two</hi> Arguments <hi>alledg'd; one to prove there was no certain</hi> Canon <hi>of the</hi> New Teſtament, <hi>and the other to evince as much for the</hi> Old. <hi>And yet it is Evident at firſt ſight, that neither of theſe Inſtances give us the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Judgment of</hi> Whole Churches, <hi>unleſs</hi> Origen <hi>and</hi> Theodorus <hi>can be prov'd to ſpeak in the Names of more People then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which I am confident can never be made out.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:43789:5"/>
            <p>Origen <hi>I am ſure delivers his own Opinion only, and yet never deſign'd to advance</hi> Hermas <hi>into the Number of</hi> Canonical Books, <hi>as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the</hi> following Diſcourſe, <hi>in Anſwer to the Second Objection</hi> (p. 25, 26, and 29, 30.) <hi>This I think I have there ſufficiently ſhown, but ſhall however add a</hi> Teſtimony <hi>or two more to the ſame purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus then he ſpeaks, in his</hi> Eighth Homily <hi>on</hi> Numbers —
<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>F.</hi> 103.</note> That one day of Sin is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd with a years Puniſhment <hi>we Read not only in this Book,</hi> wherein there is nothing whoſe Truth can be in the leaſt doubted; <hi>but the ſame things alſo are taught in the Book of the</hi> Paſtor, if any one think good to admit the Teſtimony of that Scripture. <hi>By which Words it is Evident, that</hi> Origen <hi>puts a great difference between the</hi> Paſtor of Hermas <hi>and the Book of</hi> Numbers, <hi>which was one of the</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>as well as</hi> Jewiſh, Canon. <hi>In this, he affirms every thing</hi> deliver'd, <hi>was</hi> undoubtedly true; <hi>but plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, he did not judge ſo of the former; by diſtinguiſhing it from, and placing it in oppoſition to, this, and leaving it to the</hi> Readers <hi>Diſcretion, whether he'll be concluded by the Authority of it, or no. He calls it indeed</hi> Scripture, <hi>but that was a Title frequently given to any Books, whoſe</hi> Subject <hi>was</hi> Religious; <hi>of which I have produc'd ſeveral Inſtances in the following</hi> Treatiſe, <hi>and ſhall only add here, that the</hi> Author <hi>of whom we are now ſpeaking, even</hi> Origen, <hi>in the</hi> Preface to his Books of Principles,

            <pb facs="tcp:43789:7"/>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>It ſeems not a little Extravagant to bring</hi> Theodorus of Mopſueſtia <hi>as a Witneſs for the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> firſt 300 years <hi>in the</hi> caſe now before us, <hi>ſince, if his</hi> Teſtimony <hi>proves any thing, it muſt neceſſarily reach a great way farther.

            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>This will be ſtill further manifeſt, if we confider that, for this very thing, among others, he was cenſur'd and condemn'd by the</hi> Fifth General Councel. <hi>We have none of the</hi> Writings <hi>of</hi> Theodorus <hi>now extant; nothing but what is quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him and preſerv'd by others.

               <hi>What is to be thought of the</hi> Revelation, <hi>I have hereafter declar'd</hi> (p. 42.) <hi>But as to the</hi> Book <hi>of</hi> Judith, <hi>I anſwer,</hi> (1.) <hi>That the</hi> Laodicean Fathers <hi>could not ſtrike that</hi> out <hi>of the</hi> Canon <hi>of the</hi> Primitive Church, <hi>becauſe it does not appear that it was ever</hi> in; <hi>any more then</hi> Eccleſiaſticus, Tobit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2.) <hi>As to the</hi> Story <hi>of the</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>of</hi> Nice<hi>'s alledging it as</hi> Divine <hi>(which is here hinted at) I believe it to be all</hi> Fable. <hi>St.</hi> Jeromo <hi>only tells us that it was reported or ſay'd ſo; and notwithſtanding that, it is plain by his</hi> Preface <hi>to the</hi> Proverbs, <hi>that be look'd upon it as</hi> Apocryphal; <hi>which he would never have done, if he had really believ'd the</hi> Nicene Fathers <hi>had taken it into the</hi> Canon. <hi>Neither if there had been the leaſt Evidence that they had ſo done, would the</hi> Synod of Laodicea <hi>have rejected it.

            <head>THE CANON OF THE <hi>New Teſtament</hi> VINDICATED.</head>
            <p n="1">I. OUR Author, in the beginning of this Treatiſe, falls very ſeverely on Mr. <hi>Blackall,</hi> who had charg'd him, in a Sermon before the Houſe of Commons, with queſtioning the Authority of ſome of the Books of the New Teſtament, in his Hiſtory of the Life of <hi>Milton.</hi> This he ſays was an uncharitable as well as Groundleſs Accuſation, and brings many Arguments to prove his Innocence as to that matter. I ſhall not concern my ſelf at preſent in that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, nor examine whether our Author be guilty or not of what is lay'd to his charge.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43789:14"/>I am ſure all he Alledges for his own Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a grand Impertinency, and ſuch a Notorious abuting of his Readers, as is not eaſily to be found in Writers, who are not of his Complexion. It is juſt as if a Man ſhould Vindicate himſelf from having ever Rob'd on the High-way, and as ſoon as he had finiſh'd his diſcourſe, ſhould fall upon and Spoil the next Traveller he meets For thus he after a long harangue, wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to clear himſelf from the Aſperſions of Mr. <hi>Blackall,</hi> and prove that he never inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that any of the Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might juſtly be queſtion'd, proceeds (if I underſtand Engliſh) to aſſert the ſame with open Face, and brings ſeveral Arguments, which can aim at nothing elſe but to ſink their Authority, and make Men believe there is no ſufficient ground for receiving the preſent Canon. Whether this be his Intention or no, I think will eaſily appear to any one who ſhall conſider the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He affirms (<hi>p.</hi> 52.) that ſeveral ſpurious Pieces have been quoted by the Fathers as of <hi>equal Authority</hi> with thoſe which we receive; even by thoſe Fathers upon whoſe Teſtimony the preſent Canon is Eſtabliſh'd. From whence it is evident, he would infer, that thoſe Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and our Canonical Books ought to go together, and either be equally admitted or equally rejected, ſince they are founded upon the ſame Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>He looks upon the Epiſtles of</hi> Barnabas, <hi>the Paſtor of</hi> Hermas, <hi>the Epiſtles of</hi> Polycarp,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43789:14"/>
               <hi>of</hi> Clemens <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi> Ignatius, <hi>to be all Forgeries,</hi> (p. 43, 46.) and yet he tells us (<hi>p.</hi> 44.) that the <hi>Ancients pay'd them the higheſt Reſpect, and reckon'd the firſt four of them eſpecially as good as any part of the New Teſtament.</hi> So that the Teſtimony of the Ancients for the Canon of the New Teſtament ſeems to be of no value, ſince, if we'll believe our Author, they put Forgeries in the ſame rank with the Books thereof, and eſteem'd them of the ſame Authority.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) He urges (<hi>p.</hi> 47.) that he can't underſtand why the Writings of St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſhould be receiv'd into the Canon, and thoſe of <hi>Clemens</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> be excluded, by thoſe who look upon them as Genuine. Since the two former were not Apoſtles, but only Companions and Fellow-Labourers with the Apoſtles, and ſo were the two latter as well as they.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) We Read (<hi>p.</hi> 56.) in ſo many words, that, <hi>There is not one ſingle Book of the New Teſtament, which was not refus'd by ſome of the Ancients as unjuſtly Father'd upon the Apoſtles, and really forg'd by their Adverſaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) He tells us in the ſame Page, <hi>That the Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>that of St.</hi> James, <hi>the Second of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>the Second and Third of St.</hi> John, <hi>the Epiſtle of St.</hi> Jude, <hi>and the</hi> Revelation, <hi>were a long time plainly doubted by the Ancients.</hi> And as if this had not been enough he adds (<hi>p.</hi> 64.) that <hi>they were rejected a long time by all Chriſtians, almoſt with univerſal conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43789:15"/>
            <p n="6">(6.) To ſhow that he'll leave no Stone unturn'd to expreſs the favourable Opinion he has of the New Teſtament, he brings in <hi>Celſus</hi> a Heathen (<hi>p.</hi> 60.) as a Witneſs againſt the Chriſtians, <hi>Who exclaims againſt the too great Liberty they took (as if they were drunk) of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Writings of the Goſpel, three or four or more times, that ſo they might deny whatever was urg'd againſt them, as retracted before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">(7.) To <hi>Celſus</hi> in the ſame Page, he joyns the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> (fitly enough I confeſs) who <hi>ſhew'd other Scriptures, and deny'd the Genuineneſs of the whole new Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">(8.) We are told (<hi>p.</hi> 64.) that <hi>the Ebio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites or Nazarens (who were the oldeſt Chriſtians) had a different Copy of St.</hi> Matthews <hi>Goſpel; the</hi> Marcionites <hi>had a very different one of St.</hi> Luke's; <hi>St.</hi> John's <hi>was attributed to</hi> Cerinthus; <hi>and all the Epiſtles of St.</hi> Paul <hi>were deny'd by ſome, and a different Copy of them ſhew'd by others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">(9.) He urges (<hi>p.</hi> 53, 54.) that <hi>Euſebius rejects the Acts, Goſpel, Preaching and Revelation of</hi> Peter <hi>from being Authentick for no other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Ancient or Modern VVriter (ſays he) has quoted proofs out of them. But herein</hi> Euſebius <hi>was miſtaken, for the contrary appears by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies mark'd in the Catalogue, which any Body may compare with the Originals. In another place be ſays that the Goſpels of</hi> Peter, Thomas, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias, <hi>and ſuch-like, with the Acts of</hi> John, <hi>and the other Apoſtles are Spurious, becauſe no Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick VVriter, from the Times of the Apoſtles
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43789:15"/>down to his own, has vouchſaf'd to quote them, which is abſolutely falſe of ſome of them, as we have already ſhewn. — Had</hi> Euſebius <hi>found any of theſe Pieces cited by the precedent Orthodox Writers, he would have own'd them as Genuine Productions of the Apoſtles, and admitted them, as we ſay, into the Canon. But having met no ſuch Citations, he preſently concluded there were none, which made him reject thoſe Books. And I ſay (what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready demonſtrated) that Proofs were quoted out of ſome of them long before, ſo that they might ſtill belong to the Canon for all</hi> Euſebius.</p>

               </note> But in the New Teſtament, thoſe Books only are accounted <hi>Canonical</hi> which were <hi>Writ,</hi> or however <hi>Authoriz'd,</hi> by the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>For they being the Immediate Diſciples of, and Attendants upon our Lord, and being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd by him to inſtruct the World in the Doctrin which he taught them, were without

<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not my Buſineſs here to prove that the Apoſtles <hi>were</hi> Infallible, but only to ſhow the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> that they <hi>ſhould</hi> be ſo.</note> infallible (for elſe they might have led the World into Error) and therefore their Teaching, their Writings, their Judgment ought to be receiv'd with all Veneration and Submiſſion.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> is reckon'd juſtly of the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the reſt, becauſe our Saviour was pleas'd to appear to him from Heaven, reveal his Goſpel to him in his own Perſon, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him an Apoſtle after an extraordinary manner; for he Receiv'd his Commiſſion not from Men (as himſelf tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1, 12.) but from Jeſus Chriſt and God the Father.</p>
            <p>What the Apoſtles Wrote, and what they Authoriz'd, can be known no other way, then by the Teſtimonies of thoſe who liv'd at the ſame time with them, and the Tradition of thoſe who ſucceeded them.</p>
            <p>And therefore whenever any Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd any Writings, to Inſtruct them in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, from the Apoſtles, they look'd upon thoſe Writings as <hi>Canonical,</hi> or <hi>a Rule of their Faith and Manners,</hi> in the Particulars whereof they Treated. And whenever any other Churches were aſſur'd, either by the Teſtimony of thoſe who knew it themſelves, or by certain Tradition, that ſuch and ſuch were Apoſtolical Writings, they too eſteem'd them Canonical, preſerv'd them as ſuch themſelves, and as ſuch tranſmitted them to others.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43789:17"/>
            <p n="3">III. Hence it appears, that the Written Canon encreas'd gradually in it ſelf, as the Apoſtles Writ new Books, and was likewiſe gradually ſpread over the World, as Particular Churches receiv'd thoſe Books from others, with good Teſtimonies and Evidences of their being the gennine Works of thoſe, under whoſe Names they were convey'd to them. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, if ſome Books were ſooner and ſome later receiv'd as Canonical, by the Univerſal Body of Chriſtians in all Places, becauſe either the Books themſelves, or the Teſtimonials to prove them Apoſtolical, might, nay Naturally would, be tranſmitted to ſome Churches later then others, as they were Situated nearer to, or remov'd farther from, thoſe Cities or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, where they were firſt Publiſh'd, or enjoy'd a greater or leſs intercourſe with them.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>General</hi> conveying of a <hi>great part</hi> of them over the <hi>whole</hi> Chriſtian Church, ſeems to have been perform'd in the Beginning of the Second Century, about the time of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Death, or immediately after it. For as <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> tells us, in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory (<hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 37.) there were then great numbers of Perſons, Diſciples of the Apoſtles, who travell'd over the World, building up Churches where the Apoſtles had before lay'd the Foundations, and Preaching the Faith of Chriſt in other Places, which had never heard of it before, carrying along with them the <hi>Copies of the Goſpels</hi> to all Countreys whither they Travell'd. And it is very probable, that they took with them ſome other parts of the New Teſtament beſides,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43789:18"/>ſince as we ſhall immediately ſee from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Jreneus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> they were own'd and admitted everywhere ſoon after.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. For the clearing of which, I ſhall conſider what Books were firſt taken into the Canon, by the whole Church, and what afterwards; not omitting alſo to remark that they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſome that were ſtil'd <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and others <hi>Spurious</hi> or <hi>Suppoſitious.</hi>

               <hi>Hebrews</hi> being excepted) the firſt of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the firſt of St. <hi>John, were all receiv'd over the Chriſtian World,</hi> in the time of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> as appears from his

               <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi> To him I might joyn <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the <hi>Council of Laodicea, Epiphanius, Ruffinus,</hi> &amp;c. But becauſe they Wrote a while after, when the <hi>whole Canon</hi> of the New Teſtament began to be ſettled, their Teſtimony will reach the other Books, as well as theſe under conſideration, and therefore I ſhall reſerve them for a fitter place. It's true indeed <hi>Euſebius</hi> and thoſe others did not Publiſh their Judgments on this Subject till above 300 Years after Chriſt, and therefore ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the lateſt to be Witneſſes in a caſe of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43789:18"/>this Nature. But then we ought to obſerve, not only that they ſpeak poſitively what was the general Judgment of their Days, but that <hi>three</hi> of them appeal to <hi>the Tradition of the Church,</hi> and the <hi>Teſtimony of the Ancients,</hi> who, living nearer the Age of the Apoſtles, had better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of informing themſelves from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Proofs, what were their true and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Works. It was upon this <hi>Teſtimony of Primitive and ſucceeding Writers,</hi> that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church did, in the time above mention'd, admit theſe Books as Apoſtolical, and account them for Canonical Parts of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Many of the Writings, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, are now Periſh'd, but ſome have been preſerv'd to our days, from which I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Inſtance or two, to ſhow that the Church, in the time of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> had real war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Antiquity, to look upon the Books, whereof I am now ſpeaking, as Canonical or Rules of Faith, ſince they had been eſteem'd for ſuch long before, and were attributed to them, whoſe Names they bear, by their Predeceſſors. Thus <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who flouriſh'd at the end of the Second Century, tells us expreſly, in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Preſcription of Hereticks,</hi> that <hi>the Law and the Prophets,
<note place="margin">C. 36</note> the Goſpels and Apoſtolick Writings,</hi> were the Books, <hi>from whence we are to learn our Faith.</hi> And that we may know what he meant by <hi>Goſpels and Apoſtolick Writings</hi> (for about them we are only concern'd at preſent) he does, as occaſion was offer'd, in his ſeveral Treatiſes, <hi>appeal to all the Books above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd</hi>

<note n="*" place="bottom">If it be enquir'd what Evidence we have that the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon</hi> (ſince it's quoted neither by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> nor <hi>Jreneus</hi>) <hi>belongs to this firſt ſet of Canonical Books.</hi> I anſwer, (1.)

               <hi>the Epiſtle of Athanaſius above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,</hi> did thereby own the <hi>Revelation</hi> to be properly Canonical, and the whole Church
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43789:22"/>of that Age
<note n="†" place="bottom">That the <hi>Syrians</hi> Read none of the Controverted Pieces in their Churches, beſides the <hi>Epistle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> and <hi>that of St. James,</hi> is Evident from the New Teſtament, which <hi>Ignatius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſent to be Printed in <hi>Europe,</hi> the laſt Century, and was actually Printed by <hi>Widmanſiadius</hi> at <hi>Vienna</hi> in the Year 1555. But why they do ſo may be a queſtion. It does not ſeem to be becauſe they look upon the reſt as not Canonical, for they have them too in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tongue, as we may learn from Ep. <hi>Walton</hi> and <hi>F. Simon.</hi> If I may have leave to interpoſe my Conjecture, I ſhould think it proceeds from hence; That this Tranſlation is <hi>very Ancient,</hi> and was <hi>Certainly made before the controverted Books were <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally receiv'd,</hi> and their <hi>Lectionaries</hi> or <hi>Rubricks</hi> adapted to it. And having no other Verſion made, till many years after, of the reſt of the Catholick Epiſtles and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> they would not alter the old <hi>Lectionaries</hi> (when they had one) as they muſt have done, if they had taken in the other Pieces. This may be judg'd a fond thing, and ſo it is; but not half ſo fond and contrary to common Senſe, as what is practis'd by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> theſe very <hi>Syrians,</hi> and ſome others of the Eaſtern Churches. For the Scriptures having been of old Tranſlated into the Languages of Particular Countries, that they might be underſtood by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People as well in the Publick Service as in their Private Reading, they ſtill continue (ſo Superſtitious are they in obſerving an old Cuſtom) <hi>to Read them and Celebrate their Liturgies</hi> in <hi>Latine</hi> and the Ancient Tongues of the Places ſpecified, though they are now grown quite out of uſe, and the Unlearned underſtand not one word of them.</note> (eſpecially the Orientals among whom this Book had been moſt queſtion'd) ſubmitting to their Authority, back'd with ſo good Evidence, <hi>This, as well as the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Pieces had been,</hi> was afterwards rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd as a Genuine part of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:43789:22"/>
            <p>That theſe Books were not <hi>every where</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon their <hi>firſt</hi> appearing, ſhows that the Church did not proceed raſhly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly in the caſe. And that they were <hi>every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where</hi> admitted <hi>afterward,</hi> ſhows that there was clear Proof and Evidence on their behalf, and therefore they have been ever ſince joyn'd to the reſt of the Books, which we eſteem Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. The caſe of thoſe Spurious Pieces, which were thruſt into the World under venerable Names, was clear contrary. They flouriſh'd a little and made a ſhow, when they firſt came abroad, but after a while, not being able to ſtand a ſtrict Examination, vaniſh'd and fell to nothing; ſo that little has been left of moſt of them, beſides their Names, for many Ages.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) There have been always in the Church, beſides theſe, other Writings that were call'd <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> Such under the New Teſtament, are the Works of the Ancient Fathers, which have ever been look'd upon as uſeful and of good Authority (though not infallible as the Canonical Scripture is,) being generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, not only by Pious and Learned Men, but alſo by thoſe, who liv'd in, or near, the Primitive Ages of Chriſtianity, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had better opportunities of being acquainted with the Doctrin and Practice of the firſt Preachers thereof, then we have. And among theſe, <hi>they</hi> have always been eſteem'd of the greateſt Authority (if their Character was anſwerable upon other accounts) who flouriſh'd and wrote neareſt the times of the Apoſtles. Of this ſort is (that which is call'd) the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which

However they were generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd ſooner or later, ſo that of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries of the firſt Ages, there is little remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Times, except the bare Titles.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Having premis'd thus much,
I ſhall now proceed to conſider the Objections of our Author.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Then he affirms (<hi>p.</hi> 52.) that ſeveral Spurious Books were quoted by the Fathers, as <hi>of equal Authority,</hi> with thoſe which we now receive, even by thoſe Fathers, upon whoſe Teſtimony the preſent Canon is Eſtabliſh'd. From whence, it is Evident, he would and muſt infer that thoſe Spurious and our Canonical Books ought to go together, and either be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually admitted or be equally rejected, ſince they are founded upon the ſame Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the quoting other Authors in the ſame Diſcourſes, wherein we appeal to the Writings of the Sacred Volums, is no Evidence that we Judge them of the ſame Authority. For is there any thing more uſual in Moral and Theological Treatiſes, then to Cite the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and Fathers and Philoſophers, and Poets too, ſometimes, Promiſcuouſly, as there is Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion? And yet no Man in his Wits ever thought, that by ſo doing, theſe three laſt were declar'd as infallible as the firſt. How often have <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> and others of their Rank, been quoted by Chriſtian Writers
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43789:24"/>in the ſame Diſcourſes, wherein they have fetch'd Proofs from the Evangeliſts and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? And yet, I dare ſay, they never dreamt that, for ſo doing, they might be charg'd as making <hi>Tully</hi> equal to St. <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>Seneca</hi> to St. <hi>Paul.</hi> We quote Authors, not always as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Proofs of the Truth of what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, but ſometimes becauſe they expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves handſomly, argue Pathetically, Reaſon cloſely, or to ſhow that others have been of the ſame Judgment with us, though at the ſame time we think them no more infallible then we do our ſelves. And after this manner, (that I may come cloſe to our Authors Objection) did <hi>Origen</hi> proceed, who is obſerv'd to have cited as many Apocryphal Writings as any almoſt of the Fathers (though he produces generally, if we'l believe
<note n="(i)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois's notes on Euſeb. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 38.</note> a Learned Man, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is profitable or uſeful from them) and yet he does not advance any of them into the Canon, but reſerv'd that Honour for thoſe Books to which it did belong.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Though our Author affirms in this Objection, that the Fathers quoted ſeveral Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Books as <hi>of equal Authority</hi> with thoſe which we account Canonical, yet he gives us no proof thereof, ſince the bare Citing both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is, as we have ſeen, no Evidence. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indeed he offers at (<hi>p.</hi> 44.) which ſounds like an Argument, and to that perhaps he may here refer, and therefore I have put it in the Second place, that I may allow every thing, he urges, its due force.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:43789:24"/>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> II. Therefore,
He looks upon the <hi>Epiſtle of Barnabas, the Paſtor of Hermas, the Epiſtles of Clemens Bp. of Rome, Polycarp and Ignatius to be all Forgeries</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 43. 46.) and yet tells us (<hi>p.</hi> 44.) <hi>that the Ancients pay'd them the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and reckon'd the four firſt of them eſpecially as good as any part of the New Teſtament.</hi> So that the Teſtimony of the Ancients for the Canon of the New Teſtament ſeems to be of no value, ſince, if we'l believe our Author, they put Forgeries in the ſame Rank with the Books thereof, and eſteem'd them of the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) To which I Anſwer, That the Poſitive Charge of <hi>Forgeries</hi> ſeems a little too confident, at this time of day, upon ſo many Books at a clap; moſt of which have had a good Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſeveral Ages, and have been of late days juſtified and defended by the Pens of divers of the firſt Rank for Learning and Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. But our Author has no conſideration for that. The Writers of theſe Pieces were all (if we'l be perſwaded by him) <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> whatever Opinion the World may have formerly entertain'd of the Knowledge and Piety of any of them; and their Aſſertors, Men of no Judgment and Underſtanding, who undertook a cauſe, which can't be defended. For ſo we Read (<hi>p.</hi> 38.) <hi>It's the eaſieſt task in the World (next to that of ſhewing the Ignorance and Superſtition of the Writers) to prove all theſe</hi> (and a great many more there reckon'd up) <hi>Spurious.</hi> But I ſhall crave leave to ſay, that talking and doing are very different things, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43789:25"/>our Author will find it a more difficult Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to run down ſome of theſe Pieces, then it was to heap together a Catalogue of Writers, where ſo many Collections had been already made to his hand. Cloſe Reaſoning and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are quite of another Nature, and what an excellent Talent he has at <hi>making out Forgeries,</hi> will eaſily appear to any one who ſhall take the pains to compare what he ſays in Anſwer <hi>to the Vindication of K. Charles the Martyr,</hi> either with the <hi>Book it ſelf,</hi> or the <hi>Reply of his Learned Adverſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, let that be as it will, I ſay he extreamly wrongs the Ancients in the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he here brings againſt them, when he ſays, that <hi>they reckon'd the four firſt of theſe eſpecially, as good as any part of the New Teſtament.</hi> For (1.) <hi>Euſebius</hi> was certainly as proper a Judge of what the Ancients held, as our Author; and yet he plainly ſets the Books we mention'd (<hi>p.</hi> 10.) above all others, and makes <hi>them only</hi> to be Canonical in the Judgment of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of his Predeceſſors, And though the Church in the days of

                  <p>Our Author fetches <hi>a large compaſs</hi> in ſome of his References here, but however, having formerly made ſome remarks of this Nature, in Reading theſe Fathers, I may poſſibly be able to trace him in the Books he directs us to, on this occaſion. I find therefore that <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (<hi>Ed. Par. G.

G. L. p.</hi> 202. Now how fairly the Senſe of theſe places is repreſented, will appear from what follows.</p>
                  <p>He tells us firſt (<hi>p.</hi> 44.) that <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> quote <hi>the Epiſtle of Barnabas,</hi> as <hi>Scripture;</hi> which is not true (though if it was, it ſignify'd nothing:) For in the places referr'd to, they cite it indeed, but under no ſuch Title. He ſays (<hi>p.</hi> 45.) that the <hi>Paſtor of Hermas</hi> is cited as <hi>Canonical Scripture,</hi> by <hi>Jreneus, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Origen. Jreneus</hi> indeed and <hi>Origen</hi> calls it <hi>Scripture,</hi> but not <hi>Canonical:</hi> That's our Authors addition. But <hi>Clemens</hi> does not ſo much as call it <hi>Scripture,</hi> in many of the Places mention'd. What follows concerning the Epiſtles of <hi>Clemens,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> was needleſs. We not only grant, but aſſert that they have been eſteem'd by the Ancients, though not as equal to the Books of the New Teſtament. And I doubt not but they'l continue in the ſame eſtimation, notwithſtanding the mighty attacks, with which they are threatned by this vain boaſter.</p>
               </note> The Arguments our Author brings to prove the Primitive Fathers look'd upon the four Treatiſes above-mention'd to be as good as any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43789:26"/>part of the New Teſtament, are much too weak for that end, for which they are deſign'd. They are in ſhort theſe three, (1.) That the Books are either quoted by the Ancients, or (2.) call'd by the Name of Scripture, or (3.) have been Publickly Read in Churches. Now that the bare quoting an Author does not raiſe him to an equality with the Writers of the Canon, has been already made apparent in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the firſt Objection. And as to the Title of <hi>Scripture,</hi> though that be commonly attributed to the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, yet it is ſometimes us'd in a more large and Lax Senſe for any Religious Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, both by <hi>Ancients,</hi> and <hi>Moderns.</hi> For thus, it is evident from

Neither did <hi>Tertullian</hi> without doubt, when in his Treatiſe of <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> (<hi>c.</hi> 10.) he calls the ſame Book of <hi>Hermas, Scripture;</hi> for he cenſures and inveighs againſt it in the

            <p>And indeed I cannot but wonder how our Author could be guilty of ſuch a miſtake, as to think that the bare Reading of a Book in the Publick Aſſemblies was an Argument, that it was eſteem'd part of the Canon, when not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Conſtant Practice of our Church, but alſo the poſitive declarations of the Ancients them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do in expreſs words teach us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

               <hi>Tertullian</hi> aſſures us that it had been cenſur'd by every Conncil of the Catholicks. (2) I think it is plain, that, <hi>Origen,</hi> whatever Character he may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally given of this Book, did not judge it any part of the Canon, becauſe in the beginning of the <hi>Philocalia,</hi> and particularly (<hi>c.</hi> 6.) we

If it be ask'd to which of theſe two Claſſes we aſſign the Acts of the Apoſtles, I anſwer to that of the Evangeliſts, as being the Work of one of them; and that <hi>Origen</hi> intended ſo to do, and have it reckon'd among the Books that were part of the Canon, is apparent from hence, that he Wrote <hi>Homilies</hi> thereon, which neither he nor any of the Fathers did upon <hi>Barnabas, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Clemens</hi> or any other of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Pieces under the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> But we need not uſe any Argument in the caſe. <hi>Origen</hi> himſelf expreſly aſcribes the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> to St. <hi>Luke</hi> more then once, and reckons them by Name among the <hi>other Books of the New Teſtament,</hi> in his Seventh <hi>Homily</hi> on <hi>Joſhua</hi> (<hi>f.</hi> 156.) where <hi>none</hi> of the <hi>Apocryphal, none</hi> of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Books are joyn'd with them.</p>
            <p>However it may not be amiſs to add upon this occaſion, that if a ſingle Father, or two, have had a higher Opinion of a Book then it did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, or a wrong Opinion of the Author, this will not overthrow the Argument, upon which the Divine Authority of the Books of the <hi>New

We look upon them as Divine and ſtrictly binding to Obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were either wrote or confirm'd by the Apoſtles of our Saviour, and we believe that they were ſo wrote or confirm'd by them, not upon the Teſtimonies of one or two Fathers only, but of the whole Primitive Church, who were capable of Judging in this queſtion. Our Author prevaricates, if he'd perſwade us, that the Ancients form'd their Judgment in this matter, only upon the Tradition of one or two Perſons, or even of thoſe few Treatiſes of the Ancient Writers, which are now Extant.

For it follows, <hi>Now I ſay, by more then a parity of Reaſon, that the Preaching and Revelation of</hi> Peter <hi>(for Example) were receiv'd by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and ought not to be rejected by the Moderns, if the approbation of the Fathers be a proper recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of any Book.</hi> The ſhort of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is this; that, in our Authors Opinion, there's more reaſon to look upon the <hi>Revelation and Preaching</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi> as Canonical, then the Seven Pieces above-mention'd, which are now embrac'd by the whole Church as ſuch.

For <hi>Euſebius</hi> and St. <hi>Jerome</hi> expreſly declare this Piece (as alſo the <hi>Preaching</hi> too) to be Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and <hi>Sozomen</hi> aſſures us, that though it was indeed Read in ſome Churches of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> once in the year, yet the Ancients abſolutely judg'd it a Forgery.</p>

Truly very little; he may put it all in his Eye and ſee never the worſe. For that Writer ſays poſitively, that the Compoſer of the <hi>Preaching of Peter</hi> was an Heretick, and proves it too by good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So that after all,
<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſay we have the Teſtimony but of one ſingle Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for any Authority of theſe Books (for the Reading one of them <hi>once</hi> a year in an obſcure Church or two, is a mean thing; ſee above <hi>Sect.

To ſee a Man, who profeſſes himſelf a Chriſtian, rake up the Objections, not only of the groſſeſt and moſt Profligate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but even of the very Heathens, and make uſe of them to run down the moſt Ancient and Venerable Monuments of our Religion, might eaſily raiſe a Paſſion, juſtifiable by the ſtricteſt Rules of Morality.

               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> informs us, <hi>That there were two Supreme Gods, the one, a good, the other, a bad one; that they were always at War with one another; that Manes was the Holy Ghoſt; that the Souls of Men, after their deceaſe, ſhould paſs into the Bodies of ſuch Beaſts as they had Eaten when they were alive, or be united to thoſe Trees which they had planted; that the Sun and Moon were Ships, which convey'd the faithful of their Sect to Heaven,</hi> and that <hi>the Light of the Moon depended on the number of the Souls in it, which, when ſhe was full, ſhe emptied into the Sun by degrees, and ſo grew dark again.</hi> Theſe things they believ'd, or at leaſt maintain'd, with Twenty more of as abſurd a Nature. And now, I pray, what does the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which ſuch as theſe had of the Canon, ſignify? They could find nothing in the Books of the Catholicks, wherewith to juſtify their Notions, and therefore

            <p>Here our Author brings in two Paſſages from <hi>Fauſtus the Manichee,</hi> to ſhow that He and thoſe of his Sect rejected the whole <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> That they did ſo <hi>in effect,</hi> is evident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted; for they made it of <hi>no Authority,</hi> by refuſing to be concluded by Arguments drawn from thence, pretending that it contain'd many Errors, which had been foiſted into the ſeveral Books thereof, by the Tricks and Cheats of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages, long after the Deaths of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. They maintain'd it was <hi>full of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Falſifications.</hi> And therefore <hi>Fauſtus</hi> boaſts

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43789:39"/>their fond Opinions, they without more ado ſlighted their Authority, affirming the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies produc'd againſt them, were forg'd and no part of the Doctrin deliver'd by our Bleſſed Lord and his Apoſtles. And therefore St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43789:39"/>and by, that this Father was ſo ſenſible, how far theſe miſerable Hereticks had been ſeduc'd in this matter, that he thought himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd directly to anſwer this Objection, and prove againſt his Adverſary <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he and his Party pretended, the Goſpels and Epiſtles, admitted by the Catholick Church, were Genuine and Authentick.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> That therefore we may allow our Author,
and his Objection againſt the Canon of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> drawn from the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> all the fair play that can be deſir'd, I ſhall ſtate the full Senſe thereof in the two following Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were not wrote by the Apoſtles or Apoſtolical Men,
<note n="(f)" place="margin">
                  <hi>See S. Aug. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fauſtus l.</hi> 33. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> but drawn up ſeveral years after them out of reports, Traditions, and Hiſtorical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Whoever they were that drew them up, they falſified and corrupted the pure Doctrins of Chriſtianity, by inſerting ſeveral Errors and contradictions among the Truth. And therefore the <hi>Manichees</hi> admitted the Books juſt ſo far and in ſuch particulars as they judg'd them true, and rejected the reſt as of no value.</p>
            <p>This is the utmoſt force, which can be put into the Objection; and we'll now enquire in the next place, what St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> return'd by way of Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then, to prove that the Writings of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were Genuine, and that the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles were the real Authors

                     <hi>L.</hi> 33. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> O unhappy and wretched Enemies of your own Souls! Tell me, I pray, what Books can ever be judg'd Authentick, if the Evangelical, if the Apoſtolical Writings don't deſerve to be ſo eſteem'd? How can we be ever certain of the Author of any Treatiſe in the World, if thoſe Writings, which the Church, planted by the Apoſtles in all Nations, affirms and maintains to be theirs, may yet be rejected as falſe and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious; and inſtead thereof, others be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd as really Apoſtolical, which were firſt brought to light by Hereticks, whoſe very Maſters, from whom they take their donominations, did not live till long after the Apoſtles, and yet pretend to have known better then the Univerſal Church, what Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thoſe firſt Preachers of our Religion, left behind them? Conſider the caſe of ſeveral Pieces Publiſh'd about Secular and Human Learning. There are many of this ſort, which appear under great Names, that are yet juſtly rejected by the Judicious, becauſe they are by no means conſiſtent with the Stile and Genius of them, whoſe Names they aſſume; or have never, by ſuch as were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of knowing, been declar'd and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be the Genuine Works of thoſe to whom they are aſcrib'd by the Ignorant. Do not Phyſicians, for Examples ſake, reject the Authority of divers Treatiſes, which fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad under the Name of <hi>Hippocrates?</hi> And though there may perhaps be <hi>ſome</hi> reſemblance
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43789:40"/>in Thought and Expreſſion, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that, they condemn them as Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe they fall ſhort of the real Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of that great Man, and have no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Evidence to prove their being Genuine. And for thoſe, which are indeed his Works, Whence is it that the Learned conclude they belong to him, whence is it that thoſe, who ſhould queſtion the ſame, would be laugh'd at, not refuted, but only becauſe a conſtant Tradition, from his Age down to the preſent days, has atteſted them? And he that ſhould pretend to doubt of a matter, eſtabliſh'd by the continued ſucceſſion of ſo long a time, would be accounted mad or diſtracted. Whence do Men learn that the Books of <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Cicero, Varro</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, are indeed of their compoſing, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo inform'd by the Teſtimonies of ſeveral Ages, ſucceeding and following one another? Many too have Wrote largely concerning Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, not indeed with Canonical Authority, but with a deſire of profiting others or themſelves. How know we to whom any of theſe Diſcourſes is to be aſſign'd, but only from hence that their reſpective Authors acquainted others with what they Wrote at the time when they firſt Publiſh'd the ſame, from whom it has been convey'd by ſeveral hands ſucceſſively to the preſent time, ſo that, without any doubting or heſitation we can, when examin'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any particular Diſcourſe, tell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently what to anſwer? But why do I inſiſt upon things long ſince paſt? Conſider what is now before us. Behold here the Treatiſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43789:41"/>of <hi>Fauſtus;</hi> behold my Anſwer. If any ſhould in future times enquire, which way they might be aſſur'd, that I Wrote the one, and <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the other, how could they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the Truth, but only by appealing to the Tradition, which had, from thoſe who were our contemporaries and knew what we did, been tranſmitted to Poſterity? Since then the caſe is plain and evident, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd ſo by all the World, in other Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, why ſhould it not be ſo in thoſe of the Apoſtles? Who is there ſo blinded with Madneſs, and Poſſeſs'd with the Malice of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and lying Devils, as to affirm that the Church has not the ſame ſecurity for the Books, which ſhe receives? Can we imagine, that ſo many Witneſſes of the greateſt Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Integrity, that ſuch an unanimous Number of Brethren in all Places, agreeing in the ſame aſſertions, ſhould conſpire to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the World with falſe Pieces? Or that the Churches, which derive their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in a continued line from the Apoſtles, ſhould not have their Books likewiſe convey'd to them, with as certain and ſteady a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is that upon which we admit Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical or Prophane Writings?</q> And again in another Place, <q>You that raiſe ſo many ſcruples about the Authority of our Books, How will you juſtify the Epiſtle of <hi>Manicheus</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 32. <hi>c.</hi> 21.</note> and prove that it was Wrote by him? If any one ſhould contradict you in this matter, and boldly affirm that it was none of his, but a down right Forgery, what would you reply? Would you not be ready to laugh at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Talker, would you not tell him, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43789:41"/>it was Impudence and Dotage to move any doubts concerning that, for which you had the ſucceſſive Teſtimony of ſo many Perſons from the days of your Paraclet? And have not we the ſame too, nay one of a much larger extent, for the Books of the Apoſtles? If it would be Ridiculous and Impertinent, to queſtion whether the Pieces of your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheus</hi> be Genuine, is it not much more ſo, to doubt of the Apoſtolical Writings? And are not you to be derided, or rather to be pitied, who raiſe ſo many difficulties about them, which are Eſtabliſh'd upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of ſo large and diffuſive a Teſtimony, through the ſeveral Ages and places of the Church, from the days of their firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus does the learned Father anſwer the firſt Objection, by producing thoſe grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon which the Catholicks embrac'd the Books of the New Teſtament as Authentick and Genuine.</p>
            <p>We proceed now to the ſecond Objection, which was, that whoever the Men were, which drew up the Books of the New Teſtament, they falſified and corrupted the pure Doctrins of Chriſtianity, by inſerting ſeveral Errors and Contradictions among the Truth. Now it having been already prov'd, that theſe were <hi>really</hi> the Writings of the Apoſtles and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Men, we have nothing elſe to do but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Reaſons St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alledges to ſhow, that they neither were nor could be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, nor yet had any Errors or Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inſerted in them.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:43789:42"/>
            <p>That they were not falſified or corrupted, he thus argues, <q>
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 32. <hi>c.</hi> 16.</note> You pretend to prove that <hi>Manicheus</hi> is the Paraclet or Comforter from ſome Paſſages in our Books, which yet you ſay have been corrupted. What would you reply, if we ſhould retort the charge upon you, and affirm that you had falſifiyd them in thoſe Particulars which concern your Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clet? I ſuppoſe, you'd tell us that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd you of a thing impoſſible, becauſe the Books were in the hands of all Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and you might eaſily be convict of falſe dealing by numerous and more ancient Copies. We ſay the ſame too, and urge that thoſe Arguments which are alledg'd, to ſhow you are Innocent in this matter, prove alſo that no Body elſe did or could corrupt them. For whoever ſhould firſt ſet about ſuch a thing, would quickly be confuted, and the Impoſture be diſcover'd, by conſulting other Copies, of which there is a great multitude, diſpers'd over all Countries and in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: ſo that ſuch an attempt would be equally ſilly and impoſſible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And that there might be no Cavil, upon the account of little miſtakes to be obſerv'd in ſome Copies, the Father adds — <q>For even in our days ſome Errors of the Tranſcribers are uſually corrected, either by the aſſiſtance of more ancient Books or other Languages.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this he had ſpoken more fully before, —

               <q>If there happen any diſpute concerning the exactneſs of Copies, as to the various Readings, which are but few in number and ſufficiently known to the Learned, we have recourſe to the Books of thoſe Countries
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43789:42"/>from whence we receiv'd our Copies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion together, and are willing they ſhould determine the Controverſy. Or if there ſtill appear any difference, the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Copies ought to be preferr'd before the leſs, thoſe which are moſt Ancient to thoſe of a later date, and the Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages to all others. Thus do they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, who, when they meet with any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Holy Scriptures, ſearch and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine things with a deſire to be inſtructed, not merely to cavil and diſpute.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Contradictions</hi> and <hi>Errors,</hi> which <hi>Fauſtus</hi> pretended are to be found in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> goes through all the Particulars of the Charge as they are urg'd by his Adverſary. But I ſuppoſe, it will not be expected that I ſhould do ſo too, that is none of my buſineſs. The Charge contained in the Paſſages, produc'd from <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> by our Author, is conceiv'd in <hi>general terms,</hi> and it will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for me, if thereto I return the Summe of the Father's <hi>General Anſwer,</hi> which is this, — that, <q>Since the Scriptures are Books of ſo great Authority</q> (that is, clearly prov'd to have been Wrote

            <p>There remains but one Particular more to be examin'd at preſent, and that is urg'd above in the Words of the Seventh Objection, where we are told that the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> not only deny'd the Genuineneſs of the whole <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> but <hi>alſo ſhew'd other Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not eaſy to determine what Books are here <hi>more eſpecially</hi> deſign'd by this Expreſſion. Perhaps our Author may intend thereby, the various Treatiſes Publiſh'd

            </p>
            <p>But becauſe there is place for doubting, I think it fair and reaſonable to take this Paſſage in ſuch a Senſe, <hi>as ſeems to me</hi> moſt ſerviceable to the deſign our Author is here carrying on, and ſhall therefore ſuppoſe he eſpecially intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Books, that were ſpread abroad in the Apoſtles Names, diſtinct from thoſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by Catholicks, which are all comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Manichees</hi> had ſuch Pieces is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evident from St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who tells us

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43789:43"/>and falſe Doctrins, which they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed any farther, I think my ſelf here oblig'd to take notice, that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<note n="(q)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 20.</note> in his <hi>Catalogue,</hi> mentions an <hi>Epiſtle of Chriſt to Peter and Paul,</hi> and vouches for it the Twenty Eighth Book of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> Chapter the Thirteenth: which may perhaps make the unwary Reader believe, that ſuch an Epiſtle is there ſet down, as part of the Scripture receiv'd by, and peculiar to, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt tell him, (1.) That there are but <hi>five</hi> Chapters in all the <hi>Twenty Eighth</hi> Book, and therefore the citing the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> is a miſtake. (2.) In the <hi>Fourth</hi> Chapter, where the Father ſpeaks of an Epiſtle of our Saviour, there is not one word to intimate that it was Wrote, or pretended to be Wrote, to the two Apoſtles above mention'd. (3.) Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could there be. For it would be Evident to any one, who ſhall ſeriouſly conſider the Place, that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is there arguing againſt the <hi>Manichees</hi> for pretending they would rather believe the Teſtimony of Chriſt concerning himſelf then any of his Apoſtles. To which, the Father replies, that <q>Our Saviour Wrote nothing, and therefore, if we'll believe any Relations concerning him at all, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe which were drawn up by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; that if any Epiſtle or other Piece ſhould be now produc'd in his Name, Men would preſently enquire, How it came to ly hid all this while, who it was that firſt brought it to light, whence it was that it had not been before acknowledg'd, Read, Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43789:44"/>every where in the Church, from the days of the Apoſtles? And that therefore it would be a prodigious want of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to admit that for an Epiſtle of Chriſt, which a <hi>Manichee</hi> ſhould perhaps pretend ſo to be at this time of day, and not aſſent to thoſe things as done or ſay'd by him which are related by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Whence it is apparent, that the <hi>Manichees</hi> had not <hi>actually</hi> produc'd any Writings in the Name of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at that time; and if they had, the ſame Argument would have overthrown them, which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> urges againſt thoſe Pieces which were ſhelter'd under the Titles of the Apoſtles. For certainly, as he tells <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> If there Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings had been Genuine, if they had taught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was agreeable to the Truth, <q>
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">
                     <hi>l.</hi> 22. <hi>c.</hi> 79.</note> They would have been own'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by thoſe Holy and Learned Men, who liv'd in the days of their pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and been by them and ſucceeding Ages receiv'd among the Books, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Canonical, and ſubmitted to as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule of Faith and Manners.</q> To this effect he preſſes theſe Hereticks in one place; and in
<note n="(s)" place="margin">
                  <hi>l.</hi> 28. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> another he thus beſpeaks them, — <hi>You produce a Book perhaps, which bears the Name of one of the Apoſtles, who were really choſen by our Lord, where you Read that Chriſt was not born of a Virgin. It is undoubted that either your Goſpel or ours muſt be falſe, and which do you think in your Conſciences it is moſt reaſonable to believe?</hi> Shall not I aſſent to a Book, <hi>which the Church, that was begun by Chriſt, and carried on every where by his Apoſtles in a certain order of Succeſſion to theſe days, has receiv'd and preſerv'd from the beginning?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43789:44"/>Or</hi> ſhall I give credit <hi>to a Piece produc'd by you, which the ſame Church rejects as utterly unknown to her, and was at firſt brought to the Publick view,
<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                     <hi>l.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> by Men ſo few in number,</hi> if compar'd with the whole Body of Chriſtians, and of <hi>ſo little veracity, as that they are not aſham'd to charge our great Maſter himſelf with falſhood and deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have gone through all the Parts of the Argument againſt the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> drawn from the Opinions and Practices of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and furniſh'd the Reader with the Anſwers, which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives to every Branch thereof. This our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, if he had ſo pleas'd, might have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; for the Replies are found in the very ſame Treatiſe from which he fetch'd his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. And I ſhall appeal to himſelf whether this be an ingenuous and fair way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to revive an old weather-beaten Cavil, and furbiſh it up with a great deal of Pomp and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation, as if it was able to run down a whole Army of oppoſers, when yet he neither was nor could be Ignorant, how all the force of it had been ſhatter'd and broken in pieces above a Thouſand years before he was born.</p>
            <p>But perhaps our Author will tell me, as he does Mr. <hi>Blackhall</hi> in the caſe of the <hi>Eikon Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> that he is of another Opinion, that he knew of theſe Anſwers indeed well enough before, but paſſed them over in ſilence, becauſe he judged them inſufficient. If he'll venture his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on ſuch a Reply, I cannot help it; though I would adviſe him as a friend, to offer any thing elſe rather for his Juſtification. For the World will not 'twice be impoſed upon by the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43789:45"/>ſame trick; and ſince, for inſtance, after all his Labour and ſhuffling, the Teſtimonies of Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi> and Doctor <hi>Walker will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,</hi> which he had pretended might be done with a wet Finger, Men will be ſo ſurly and ill natur'd, as to think, that it is ſomething elſe, and not the weakneſs of an Argument, or Anſwer, that makes him ſay nothing to it.</p>
            <p>But to let that paſs at preſent, I proceed to remark how upon this occaſion we are told (<hi>p.</hi> 63.) that the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> of the <hi>Manicheans had power enough to be counted Orthodox.</hi> And was there indeed no difference, good Sir, between the two Parties, but that? Do you indeed believe the <hi>Manichean</hi> Doctrin was true? Do you believe the Exiſtence of two Supreme Gods, a Good one and a Bad? Do you believe the Tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of Souls, and the other Whimſies which were aſſerted by thoſe Brainſick Hereticks? If you do, ſpeak out, and then <hi>we ſhall know</hi> (as you expreſs it <hi>p.</hi> 49.) <hi>where to have you, and how to deal with you.</hi> If you do not, is not this an excellent and very commendable way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, to endeavour to draw your Readers to believe that of which you believe nothing your ſelf; and to perſwade them that it was nothing but <hi>Power,</hi> which diſtinguiſh'd the <hi>Catholicks</hi> from the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> and made them be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Orthodox.</hi> This is the Eternal Clamour of this kind of Men. They'll have it to be only Power and Intereſt, which keeps us in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Catholick Doctrin, and if it was not for that, they ſay we would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſake it. But, pray, Sir, (not to inſiſt now upon the fury and violence of the <hi>Arians</hi>) What Power had the Catholicks in the firſt 300
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43789:45"/>years? What force had they then to compel Men to embrace their Doctrin, when they lay under the ſharpeſt Perſecutions, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly expos'd to the Fire, to the Sword, and to other ſevere Tortures, themſelves? And yet even then, they ſtood up ſtoutly for the Truth, and inflicted Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures on thoſe Hereticks who corrupted the Faith, and met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Councils, to condemn their Erroneous Opinions, even at the Peril of their Lives. This they did in the caſe of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> They held two Councils there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his account; the Biſhops when they heard his Opinion, that he aſſerted Jeſus Chriſt to be no more then a meer Man, came together from ſeveral parts, as againſt a Spoiler and Deſtroyer of our Lords Flock (ſo <hi>Euſebius</hi>

Though he kept Poſſeſſion of the Epiſcopal Chair and Houſe for three years after the Sentence (as the Learned inform us) by the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Zenobia</hi> Queen of <hi>Palmyra.</hi> And here I hope (what our Author in his fleering way calls) Orthodoxy and Power were not on the ſame ſide. Nevertheleſs the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did not flinch for the matter, but though <hi>Zenobia</hi> aſſerted the cauſe of <hi>Paulus,</hi> yet they refus'd to Communicate with him as being a Convict Heretick, after they had ſufficiently prov'd him ſo to be.</p>

               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teaches us. Beſides, they only admitted the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Prophets, deriding and curſing <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon, Elijah, Eliſha, Eſay, Jeremy</hi> and the reſt, wherein they were perfectly diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Nazarens,</hi> who own'd and eſteem'd them all. However both Parties, as we have ſeen, agreed in this, that they rejected all St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, deſpis'd all the other Goſpels, and receiv'd only that of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which they had more or leſs alter'd with their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polations.</p>
            <p>And now are not theſe excellent Witneſſes for our Author againſt the eſtabliſh'd Canon? Do not they effectually prove, that the Epiſtles, we have under St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Name, are falſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd to him, who (as we above obſerv'd) inveigh'd againſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, as a Deſerter of the Law, as a Cheat and Impoſtor; and in contempt, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> farther remarks, us'd
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43789:48"/>to call him, <hi>the Man of Tarſus,</hi> and would needs have him, though born a <hi>Jew,</hi> to be a Gentile Proſelyte. They rejected not the Epiſtles, but becauſe they rejected the Apoſtle himſelf and his Doctrine. When our Author tells the World he does ſo too, I may think my ſelf oblig'd to defend our Religion againſt him, and theſe Judaizers, whom we are now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>At preſent, my buſineſs is only to aſſert that our Canon is Genuine, and the Books, which we receive, the true Writings of thoſe to whom they are aſcrib'd. This the <hi>Ebionites</hi> deny'd not, but endeavour'd to run down <hi>the Writers themſelves,</hi> and ſince they had ſo little Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity as to attempt that, I think, I may ſafely ſay, there can be no difficulty in determining whether the Copies of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which they kept, or that which was preſerv'd by <hi>the whole Catholick Church</hi> beſides, ought to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Authentick.</p>

                     <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 25.</note> another place he ſays that the Goſpel of</hi> Peter, Thomas, Matthias <hi>and ſuch like, with the Acts of</hi> Andrew, John <hi>and the other Apoſtles are Spurious, becauſe no Eccleſiaſtick Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, from the time of the Apoſtles down to his own, has vouchſaf'd to quote them; which is abſolutely falſe of ſome, as we have already ſeen. — Had</hi> Euſebius <hi>found any of theſe Pieces cited by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Orthodox Writers, he would have own'd them as genuine Productions of the Apoſtles, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, as we ſay, into the Canon. But having met with no ſuch Citations, he preſently concluded there were none; which made him reject theſe Books. And I ſay (what I have already demonſtrated) that proofs were quoted out of ſome of them long before, ſo that they might ſtill belong to the Canon for all</hi> Euſebius.</p>
            <p>This is a long-winded Objection, but we ſhall better underſtand what ſtrength there is in it, if it be divided into the three following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. (1.) That <hi>Euſebius</hi> rejects the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſay'd Books, only becauſe he thought that none of them had been quoted and mention'd by the Ancients; when yet ſome of them really were. (2.) That if he had known, they had been ſo quoted, he would have look'd upon them as Canonical. (3.) It being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent therefore, that they were ſo quoted by the Ancients, they ought, according to <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Principles, to be eſteem'd Canonical. This is the force of the Objection, and to this there are two Anſwers drawn up, which it is pretended we are like to make. But of all People in the World, I ſhall not truſt our Author to give in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43789:50"/>any Anſwers in my Name. If they be good for any thing, he'll certainly leave them behind him. Thus he did in the caſe of <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who had furniſh'd him with very good ones to the Objections of <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> but he fairly dropt them by the way, and ſo left the Heathen and the Heretick in Poſſeſſion of the Field. And I dare ſay, that if he had not thought he could eaſily overthrow thoſe Anſwers he produces in this place in the Name of his Adverſaries, we ſhould never have heard one word of them. I am reſolv'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to have nothing to do with his Anſwers, whether good or bad, but ſhall give in ſuch as I will ſtand by, and accordingly ſpeak to the above-mention'd Propoſitions in their order.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that <hi>Euſebius</hi> rejects the forefaid Books only becauſe he thought they were none of them quoted or mention'd by the Ancients, when yet ſome of them really were. To which I anſwer, (1.) That <hi>Euſebius</hi> could not be Ignorant, that ſome of theſe Pieces are quoted by <hi>Clemens of Alexandria</hi> (who mentions them ſeveral times) being very much converſant in the works of that Father, and having expreſly taken notice that
<note n="(d)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl. Hiſt. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> 
               <hi>one of them was cited by him;</hi> and therefore when he ſays that none of theſe Books are quoted by the Ancients, he muſt be underſtood to mean (not that they are never quoted at all, for that he knew they were, and ſays ſo expreſly concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of St. <hi>Peter</hi> (<hi>Eccleſ. Hiſt. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 25.) but) that they were never quoted by any as Canonical, and this was a ſufficient reaſon, why he ſhould not admit them under that notion.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43789:51"/>Though (2.) this is not the only Reaſon; for he obſerves of ſeveral of them, that
<note n="(e)" place="margin">
                  <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 25.</note> they contain'd a Doctrine contrary to the Catholick Faith which was planted by the Apoſtles, and therefore ought to be cenſur'd and rejected as the undoubted Contrivances and Forgeries of Hereticks.</p>
            <p>The Second Propoſition is, That if <hi>Euſebius</hi> had known that any of theſe Pieces had been ever quoted by the Ancients, he would have eſteem'd them Canonical. I anſwer, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what has been juſt now ſay'd, that <hi>Euſebius</hi> did know it and yet would not receive them into the Canon. The bare quoting a Book, except it be quoted as part of the Rule of Faith, or a Genuine Writing Compos'd or Authoriz'd by the Apoſtles, ſignifies nothing in this caſe, as has been allready prov'd. Nay, I ſhall further add, that if <hi>Euſebius</hi> had known, that <hi>ſome</hi> of the Ancients had really quoted one or more of theſe Pieces as Canonical, <hi>that</hi> alone would not have induc'd him to receive them as ſuch. For this was the very caſe of the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James,</hi> the Second of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the once controverted Pieces. They were quoted by many, and quoted by many too as Canonical, yet becauſe the whole Church was not then acquainted with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which afterward ſatisfied her to admit theſe Books as parts of the Code of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> we ſee that they were lay'd aſide and not advanc'd to that honour by <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:43789:51"/>
            <p>The Third Propoſition is, That ſince theſe Acts, Goſpel, Preaching, Revelation of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the others, were ſome of them really quoted by the Ancients, they ought, according to the Principles of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> to be receiv'd for Canonical. I anſwer, No; unleſs quoted as Canonical, and prov'd Canonical too, by ſuch Teſtimonies as were ſufficient to ſatisfy the Catholick Church, as appears by the Inſtances of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of St. <hi>James,</hi> and the reſt above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd. When <hi>Euſebius</hi> could not meet with ſo much as <hi>one</hi> Primitive Father, who cited theſe Books for Canonical, <hi>that alone</hi> (though he had another reaſon too againſt divers of them, as appears before) was ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for him to reject them. But for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing them into the Canon, a conſtant and well atteſted Tradition, by ſuch as were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of Judging, from the firſt Ages, that they had been prov'd Genuine, upon Authentick Teſtimonies, was requiſite in his Opinion, and therefore our Authors Objection vaniſhes into air and ſignifies juſt nothing.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> X. I come now to the laſt Objection,
which is founded on a long Paſſage of Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> who (as is inſinuated) reflects more upon the Certainly and Authority of the Canon of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> then any thing, which had been before excepted againſt, in our Author. This is uſher'd in, with great Pomp and Ceremony; for we Read (<hi>p.</hi> 69.) that <hi>Mr.</hi> D. <hi>alone, though a Layman, underſtands as much Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, as the Divines of all Churches put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> This is a high flight indeed; methinks
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43789:52"/>it had been enough to have made him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand as much as all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines, but to bring in the Divines of all other Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, is a little too Extravagant, and more, I am certain, then our Author can poſſibly know. I ſhall not in the leaſt detract from the true Character of that worthy Gentleman, who ought to be (and I believe generally is) valued for his great Learning and Piety, and will, I am confident give our Author no thanks for his Complement, or for bringing him in as a Witneſs in the caſe now before us. For he is quite of another Opinion, and tells us expreſly but a few Pages before that Paſſage which is produc'd by our Author, that
<note n="(f)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 36. <hi>p.</hi> 62.</note> 
               <hi>there is no manner of reaſon to doubt of that Tradition, which has tranſmitted to us the Canon of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This, I think, is a point blank contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Natural deſign and tendency of the Treatiſe we are now conſidering, ſince <hi>that</hi> runs all into confuſion, and plainly aims at the perſwading Men, that in the Buſineſs of the Canon, we have nothing but Darkneſs and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s Principal Intention in the long Paſſage quoted from him, was to ſhow, that we have as good Evidence, that the <hi>Practical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> (as for Inſtance, Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) which obtain'd in the time of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> and were deliver'd <hi>as ſuch,</hi> were really <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Inſtitutions,</hi> as there is for the Canon of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> becauſe the Books, we now receive for <hi>Canonical or our Rule of Faith,</hi> were not ſo fix'd and determin'd till the beginning of the Second Century, as to be appeal'd to by the Chriſtian Church under that notion. And
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43789:52"/>they were then ſettled upon the Teſtimony of the ſame Perſons (and ſent
<note n="(g)" place="margin">
                  <hi>See his Addenda to p.</hi> 73. <hi>and his Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi>

            <p>This I take to be the main deſign of the Paſſage now before us, with what proceeds and follows in the Original (from Section 35 to Section 41 incluſively;) but becauſe there are ſome Particulars therein, which may deſerve a little further clearing or illuſtration, I ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a few Pages thereupon, and if in any thing I differ from that Learned Gentleman, I know he'l allow me the ſame Liberty of Thought and Judgment, concerning matters of Fact, which himſelf took before me.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/> While the Apoſtles travell'd up and down,
Preaching in ſeveral Places and Countries, they Wrote thoſe Pieces, which we now have under their Names, but for the <hi>moſt</hi> part, as Criticks obſerve, <hi>after</hi> the middle of the Firſt Century.

            <p>All the Inference I intend to make from hence, is only this, that theſe Books, from whence the Authors juſt now mention'd, fetch'd all the Paſſages we refer to, were then undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly diſpers'd abroad in <hi>ſome parts</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, ſince they had been Read by theſe Fathers, and were made uſe of by them in their Writings.

            <p>It's true, the Writers we are now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, very rarely give us
<note n="†" place="bottom">This is urg'd as an Objection, that none of the Evangeliſts is call'd by his own Name, in the Writings of <hi>Clemens,</hi> &amp;c. I grant it; but what would be infer'd from thence, beſides what is here conſider'd, I cannot imagine. Whatever is intended, will equally affect the Old Teſtament. For St. <hi>Clemens,</hi> among all the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations he fetches thence, does not that I perceive (and I was careful in making the obſervation) ſo much as once <hi>directly cite by Name</hi> any of the Writers thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David</hi> once or twice, from which he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces his Teſtimonies. And yet there's no queſtion, but he judg'd the <hi>Old Testament</hi> Canonical. As <hi>Juſtin M.</hi> certainly did the <hi>New;</hi> and yet though he makes uſe of many Places, out of ſeveral Books thereof, and ſpeaks of the Goſpels, and Monuments of the Apoſtles, in general, I am very much miſtaken, if he quotes any of them by Name, beſides the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which he expreſly aſcribes to St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle.</note> the Name of the Book or Author from whence they fetch any Paſſage, and therefore Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s remark is very juſt, that the ſucceeding Ages of the Church could not, <hi>in ſuch caſes,</hi> learn from them what Pieces were to be parts of the Chriſtian Canon. They produce Texts indeed from Authors that were Canonical, but they don't always tell us ſo, when they produce them; and therefore their Teſtimony alone is not ſufficient to inform us, what are the Genuine Writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and what are not. This we can learn from none but thoſe, who either recommend a particular Book by Name, or at leaſt tell us whence they draw their Paſſages. And this is ſo ſeldom done by the Authors now mention'd, that all the Evidence we can derive from them,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43789:54"/>will not extend to above
<note n="(u)" place="margin">The firſt Epiſtle to the Corinth. the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to the Epheſ. and to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians.</note> three or four Pieces. The aſſurance we have that the other Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are Canonical, muſt be taken from the Writers of the Second Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, at leaſt as far as we know now, (I mean ſuch Writers as follow'd <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> here mention'd by Mr. <hi>D.</hi>) and the Teſtimony of them is unexceptionable, ſince converſing with the Diſciples of the Apoſtles, they could eaſily be inform'd by them what Books were really Genuine and Apoſtolical.</p>
            <p>But we are told, that <hi>the Writers of thoſe times do not chequer their Works with Texts of the New Teſtament, which yet is the cuſtom of the more Modern, and was alſo theirs in ſuch Books as they acknowledg'd for Scripture. For they moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cite the Books of the Old Teſtament, and would doubtleſs have done ſo by thoſe of the New, if they had been receiv'd for Canonical.</hi> That the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> could not fail of being judg'd <hi>Canonical,</hi> by thoſe who knew their Authors, has been obſerv'd already more then once; and therefore I proceed to remark, that if theſe words refer to the latter Writers of the Canon, they are expreſs'd very obſcurely, and will fall under conſideration immediately. If they be deſign'd to comprehend <hi>Clemens, Barnabas, Hermas, Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> (and I think, they can't be underſtood otherwiſe) I muſt confeſs that I wonder very much at them. For the two firſt fetch Paſſages from the <hi>New Teſtament as well</hi> (though not ſo often) <hi>as</hi> from the <hi>Old.</hi> The third may be ſuppos'd to cite neither or both. The fourth and fifth have certainly more Texts out of the Goſpels and Epiſtles then out of the whole <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:43789:55"/>And the latter of theſe two, I mean <hi>Polycarp,</hi> has above Twenty Paſſages out of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in his ſhort Epiſtle, ſo that it may very well be ſay'd to be <hi>chequer'd</hi> with them.</p>

For the <hi>former</hi> is the caſe of ſeveral Prophets and Writers of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> who don't quote their Predeceſſors; and thoſe things which now ſeem contradictions to us, might perhaps be little or none to them, who were acquainted with the Circumſtances of the Age, and admit, it may be, as eaſy a ſolution, as the difference of the genealogies upon account of the Natural and Legal Fathers, does from

And that <hi>he</hi> had alſo Read St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel, St. <hi>Paul</hi> that of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> all the other three, has been above prov'd by Eccleſiaſtical Teſtimony. To which I ſhall add, that <hi>Grotius</hi> affirms St. <hi>Luke</hi> to have certainly Read the Goſpels of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and proves it from hence, becauſe in reporting the ſame Paſſages, he ſometimes uſes their very Words.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/> I dare not affirm,
that the Fathers of whom we are now ſpeaking, cited any Texts from ſuch Goſpels, as are <hi>properly Spurious,</hi> becauſe it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43789:55"/>does not appear to me;
<note n="(z)" place="margin">See above Sect. V. in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> much leſs that they attributed the ſame Authority to them, that they did to the Genuine Writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, becauſe of this there is no manner of Evidence. For though there be ſome Paſſages in them which are not mention'd in our Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and others differently expreſs'd from what we now Read, yet no ſuch conſequence can be drawn from theſe Premiſes.</p>
            <p>For firſt, the Citations might perhaps be made from no Books at all. Thus, though it be true that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> cite an Expreſſion or two as ſpoken by our Saviour, which are not to be found in our Goſpels, yet it does not follow that they took them from Spurious Writers; they might eaſily receive them from Ear-Witneſſes. They were remov'd at ſo little a diſtance from our Saviour, that they certainly convers'd with his immediate Diſciples, from whom they might hear Relations of ſeveral conſiderable Actions and Sayings of his, which were not recorded by the Evangeliſts.</p>
            <p>Neither does it follow, that if a Paſſage be not expreſs'd juſt after the ſame manner that we find it in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> therefore it ought to be look'd upon as <hi>interpolated</hi> or drawn from the Books of ſome <hi>Spurious Writers.</hi> For it is well known, that many of the Fathers, as well of the later as of the firſt Ages, quote the Texts of Scripture by memory, and often deſign to give the Senſe, without confining themſelves to the Words, of the Original. Many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be given of this Nature, but I ſhall refer the Reader at preſent only to the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> where he'll find nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous

            <p>But if we ſhould go further, and ſuppoſe that ſome of the Writers of that Age, quoted other Goſpels or Hiſtories of our Lord, then thoſe which are now eſteem'd Authentick in the Church, yet I don't ſee what can be infer'd from thence, that may be in the leaſt a Prejudice to our cauſe, or ſhew that there was no difference <hi>then</hi> put between Spurious and Genuine Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Though it is poſſible there might be ſome Spurious Goſpels at thoſe times forg'd and ſet forth under great Names; yet that there were <hi>ſome</hi> too Wrote by honeſt Chriſtians, beſides the inſpired ones, cannot, I think, be doubted by any who ſhall conſider what is the uſual Practice of Mankind on ſuch <hi>great</hi> Occaſions. And to ſome of theſe as well as the Goſpels of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> in all probability refers at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his. For notwithſtanding what our Author (<hi>p.</hi> 50.) and others beſides him are pleas'd to ſay, yet I doubt not to affirm, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> does not faſten any bad Character on the Goſpels he had Read, nor can his Words be drawn to inſinuate any ſuch thing without the greateſt Violence. Nay it ſeems plain to me that the two firſt Verſes of his Goſpel intimate the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And in this I am the more confirm'd, becauſe ſince the Writing of this, I find that <hi>Caſaubon</hi> and <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> are of the ſame Opinion as to the whole; and <hi>Grotius</hi> ſeems to have judg'd ſo too in the main. Only he thinks that ſome of theſe Writers, gathering what they related, from uncertain Report, fell into great Errors. That may be (and queſtionleſs was) true of ſome, but not of all. And St. <hi>Luke</hi> does not ſeem to have ſeen any Spurious (if at leaſt any ſuch were extant ſo early) or Erroneous Goſpels. For he does not charge thoſe, who labour'd before him in that Argument, either with wilful falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations or negligent miſtakes.</note> For I think, it can't be queſtion'd,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43789:56"/>but that ſeveral would Publiſh Accounts of the Life and Actions of our Saviour, who were his honeſt and Faithful Diſciples, and inſerted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Story, but what they had good ground to believe true and certain, though they were not infallible in their Narrations. From ſome of theſe, the Writers that follow'd after might quote Paſſages, and that juſtifiably enough, as from thoſe, whom they eſteem'd (and who were as to the main) faithful Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Though when the four Goſpels, which we now have, were <hi>Publiſh'd to the whole Church,</hi> the eſtimation of thoſe other Hiſtories might ſink, and ſo they not be tranſmitted to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as not being of equal Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> And as there were <hi>Hiſtories of the Life and Preaching</hi> of our Lord, ſo were there too with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt Relations of the Miracles and Actions of his Followers, and <hi>Summaries of the Doctrines and Inſtructions of the Apoſtles:</hi> which being drawn up by thoſe who heard and convers'd with them, were really of great uſe to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and might be quoted by them upon occaſion without any manner of blame. Many of theſe, Learned Men judge it probable, were in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time collected into one Body with the <hi>Doctrines of Apoſtolical Men</hi> written afterwards, and make up the beſt and moſt Inſtructive part of thoſe, which are call'd the <hi>Apoſtolical Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</hi> Though the addition of ſeveral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences, Errors, Hereſies and Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and eſpecially the <hi>pretending</hi> (in divers places) <hi>the whole to have been dictated by the Twelve Apoſtles, St.</hi> James <hi>Bp. of</hi> Jeruſalem (whom they Erroneouſly diſtinguiſh from the

            <p>From what has been ſay'd, it is apparent, I think, that we ought not preſently to conclude every thing which is not found in our Bibles, to be fetch'd from <hi>Spurious Writings,</hi> ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſerves <hi>that Name,</hi> but what is properly <hi>a Forgery. Several of theſe</hi> there were indeed in thoſe early days, but it no ways appears that the Writers we are now diſcourſing of, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from them. More likely it is that what they took from Books not Apoſtolical, was from the accounts (given by the true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Lord) of the Actions, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Doctrine of himſelf and his Apoſtles; which though they were not part of the Canon, yet were really uſeful, and might, for that reaſon, be Read with Profit and quoted with Authority as Pieces Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXV"/> But there is one Particular,
which deſerves a more accurate examination. It is <hi>p.</hi> 72. of our Authors Citation out of Mr. <hi>D.</hi> were <hi>two Johns</hi> are reckon'd among the Writers of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> This that Learned Gentleman had before enlarg'd on in the 4th and 5th Sections of the ſame Diſcourſe, and will have <hi>John,</hi> a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter of that time, and not <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, to have been the Author of the <hi>Revelation</hi> and alſo of the Second and Third Epiſtle. The main Arguments he inſiſts upon are, (1.) The Authority of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:43789:57"/>part of whoſe Diſcourſe upon that Subject, we have in the
<note n="(d)" place="margin">
                  <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 25.</note> 
               <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Euſebius.</hi> (2.) The Reaſons of that Father, which are the difference of the Style, and that the Author of the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſets down his Name frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle does not in his other Pieces.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, That neither the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority nor the Reaſons of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> affect the two Epiſtles. <hi>He does not at all argue againſt them;</hi> and therefore they may be the Genuine Works of that Apoſtle, to whom (as he owns) they were commonly aſcrib'd, for all him. And <hi>Monſieur du Pin,</hi> who has the deſerv'd Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an able Critick, tells us <hi>that the Style, the Spirit, and the Thoughts of theſe Epiſtles,</hi> as well as the concurring Judgment of moſt of the Fathers, <hi>make it evident that they belong to the Evangeliſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Setting them therefore aſide, I ſhall conſider what force there is in theſe Reaſons as they are levell'd againſt the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And I muſt ſay, that, if they have any ſtrength in them, they may as well be urg'd to prove the <hi>Prophecy of Jeremy</hi> and the <hi>Lamentations</hi> were not wrote by the ſame Perſon. For in the former, the Prophet often Names himſelf, which he does not once in the latter; and the difference of Expreſſion ſeems every jot as great between theſe two Pieces, as it is between them we are now conſidering.</p>
            <p>Neither is it any wonder to find the ſame Perſon (as Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> obſerves in another caſe) vaſtly to alter and vary his Style, according to the <hi>Times when,</hi> or the <hi>Perſons to whom,</hi> or the <hi>Subjects about which,</hi> he Writes; or the <hi>Temper
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43789:58"/>and diſpoſition</hi> he is in, when he Writes, or <hi>the Care,</hi> that is us'd in doing it. So that it is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, nothing <hi>certain</hi> can in this caſe be infer'd from that Particular.</p>
            <p>To the Authority of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons too, we oppoſe the Judgment of many of the Ancients, who were of another Opinion. The Arguments he urges, were obvious to them as well as him. They knew what difference there was between the Style of the other Pieces of St. <hi>John</hi> and the <hi>Revelation;</hi> they knew, that in one, the Writers Name was ſeveral times mention'd and not at all in the other; and yet concluded there was no force in theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, concluded notwithſtanding them, that all the Pieces were Wrote by the ſame Author, even the Apoſtle, of which they could eaſily receive information as being remov'd at ſo little a diſtance from his time. Two of them ſeem to have been Born ſoon after, if not before his Death.</p>
            <p>Let us hear therefore what may be alledg'd on the other ſide. (1.) The Author of the <hi>Revelation</hi>

But if the thing had happen'd, and ſome ſubtile Sophiſter had ſo far impos'd upon <hi>Clemens, Ignatius,</hi> and the reſt, by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting their Inſtructors Hands and Styles, as to put a falſe Epiſtle or Goſpel upon them <hi>for a while,</hi> (of which I am not ſenſible,) this would not have been ſo wonderful a thing, as we are made to believe, ſince even <hi>Scriveners</hi> and <hi>Merchants,</hi> thoſe cunning Maſters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, have yet been trick'd after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>However I ſhall readily yield, that (whether the Apoſtolick Perſons juſt now mention'd were ſo impos'd on or no, and I believe they were not, yet) many of that Age, might and probably were deceiv'd, for ſome time, with Suppoſititious Writings, uſher'd into the World, under the Title of great Names. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion will make room for our Author's ſecond difficulty.</p>

               <hi>Since they were in the dark,
how came others after them to a better light?</hi> Before I give an anſwer to this queſtion, I cannot but remark, that it comes very oddly from our Author, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make ſuch diſcoveries, and undertakes to prove thoſe Pieces full of Ignorance and Superſitition, which had been generally well eſteem'd till his days. Do you think, Sir, there was never an <hi>I. T.</hi> among the Ancients? None that could ſmell out an Impoſture, or by making a few remarks and asking a few queſtions, find that a Book was aſcrib'd to a wrong Author? You may think thus if you pleaſe, and value your ſelf as much as you can upon the account of your great Atchievements; but I believe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of Opinion, that, if the Fathers had gone your untoward way to work, and dealt no fairer, when they were in queſt of Forgeries, then you have done with the Evidences in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Eikon Baſilike,</hi> many of thoſe cheats might have remain'd longer in credit, which yet <hi>they</hi> quickly flung out of doors, only by the aſſiſtance of a little Reaſon, Honeſty, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe. We had an inſtance of this nature among us at the beginning of the late Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Three Declarations were then Publiſh'd in the Name of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd his for ſome time by the whole Nation. But upon a ſtrict examination of the matter, the <hi>Third</hi> was found Suppoſititious, diſown'd by the pretended Author,
<note n="(q)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hiſtory of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. p.</hi> 89.</note> and acknowledg'd by all to be a Forgery. And thus it was in the Primitive times. Some indeed of the Pieces which appear'd in the Apoſtles Names, ſeem to have been ſo contrary to their Doctrine, that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43789:60"/>they quickly ſunk and were rejected on all hands. But others, being of a more skilful compoſition, preſerv'd their Reputation for a longer time, and were eſteem'd by ſuch as knew no better, for the Monuments of them, whoſe Names they carried in their front. However theſe, by comparing them with their Genuine Writings, or enquiring of the Apoſtles, or thoſe who convers'd with and were inſtructed by them, had their Glorious Vizours pluck'd off and were expos'd as Impoſtures. But this could not be done ſo ſoon as the Third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was unmask'd here. It was a ſingle Piece, aſcrib'd to a ſingle Perſon, and ſcatter'd abroad no further then the compaſs of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Iſland, and therefore Application might in a few days be made to the Prince, as it was, and the cheat, by that means, ſpeedily lay'd open. Whereas in the caſe, concerning which we are now diſcourſing, the Forgeries were <hi>many,</hi> they were attributed to <hi>ſeveral Perſons,</hi> and ſpread abroad over <hi>different Places</hi> of the Chriſtian Church, ſo that it muſt neceſſarily require a conſiderable time, before they could be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently examin'd, before the pretended Authors, or thoſe acquainted with them, could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted. But at laſt Truth prevail'd, and all the Impoſtures of the firſt and alſo of the ſecond Age, when they afterwards appear'd, were (as we learn from Eccleſiaſtical Story) found out to be what they really were, and as ſuch ſlighted and generally undervalued. Though ſtill, after the cheat was expos'd, Learned Men us'd them upon occaſion, and quoted ſuch ſingle Paſſages out of them, as they thought might be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43789:60"/>of value, and Pertinent to the deſigns upon which they were Writing.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVIII"/> I proceed now to our Authors third difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<note n="(r)" place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 79.</note> 
               <hi>Why all thoſe Books, which are cited by</hi> Clemens <hi>and the reſt, ſhould not be accounted equally Authentick.</hi> Whoever Reads this Paſſage, and does not underſtand the caſe, will, I believe, be apt to imagine that the Fathers here refer'd to, quote many Books that have Relation to the ſtate of things under the Goſpel, ſome of which we do, upon their Authority, admit for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, while we reject others, that are equally cited by them, as Spurious.</p>
            <p>How far we make uſe of theſe Fathers for ſettling the Canon, has been above explain'd. It's manifeſt from what is there ſay'd,
<note n="(s)" place="margin">Sect. XXI.</note> that we employ them, only (in conjunction with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) to aſſert the Title of three or four Pieces. So many they expreſly Name and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to their proper Authors, and thereby teach us that they were compos'd by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and conſequently ought to be reckon'd as Wrote by Inſpiration, and of Divine Authority. We infer nothing from them to juſtify the reſt, but ſupport them by other Evidence.</p>
            <p>Well, but ought not the Teſtimony of theſe Fathers be allow'd in behalf of other Pieces, which they quote, and transfer them from the Rank of Spurious, wherein they are now plac'd by ſome, to that of Canonical Writings? Why, truly, much might be done, if we <hi>knew what the Books were,</hi> and <hi>that they deſign'd to quote them as the Genuine Writings of the Apoſtles.</hi> But this is our unhappineſs (of which our Author ſeems not to have been ſenſible, though he has
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43789:61"/>undertaken, upon occaſion, to blaſt the credit of all theſe Pieces together) that though <hi>Clemens</hi> has quoted three, <hi>Ignatius</hi> as many, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſeven or eight ſhort Paſſages, that do not occur in our Books of Scripture, yet they neither give us the Name <hi>of the Treatiſe,</hi> nor yet of <hi>the Author,</hi> whence they produce them, and how, without that, the Books or the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſhould be put into the Canon, I can't imagine.</p>
            <p>However, I love to deal fairly, and ſhall own that one of the Paſſages, which we find in
<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep. to the Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans p.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>Ignatius,</hi> is ſaid to have been found in the Goſpel according to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which is the ſame with that of the <hi>Nazarens.</hi> So it may be, but <hi>Ignatius</hi> does not quote it from thence. He might have it from other Books beſides that, or receive it from Tradition, or take it upon Memory. The Words in <hi>Ignatius</hi> are, <hi>Handle me, and feel me, and ſee that I am not an Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
<note n="†" place="bottom">I render the <hi>Greek</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) Spirit or Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, becauſe one of thoſe Words is always us'd by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to expreſs the ſame thing, which is here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Greek.</hi>

                  <hi>C.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 39.</note> St. <hi>Luke</hi> we Read, <hi>Handle me and ſee, for a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Bones, as ye ſee me have.</hi> The Senſe is exactly the ſame in both, and if the Father made the quotation, without looking into the Book, he might eaſily miſtake as far as this comes to.</p>
            <p>But what, if we grant our Author all he can deſire, and ſhould yield that this Paſſage was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43789:61"/>taken by <hi>Ignatius</hi> out of the Goſpel according to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (which will never be prov'd,) what can he infer from thence? <hi>That</hi> we ſhall eaſily ſee, if we compare this with thoſe places, where Texts taken out of the Goſpels and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles have been mention'd by theſe Writers. We find, for Inſtance, that St. <hi>Clemens</hi> gives us ſeveral Paſſages that are to be met with, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> alſo gives us one or two, that are in the Goſpel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Matthew</hi> or the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> All that we argue <hi>from hence,</hi> is, that thoſe Books, from which theſe two Fathers borrow thoſe Paſſages, were then extant and abroad in the Church. But we cannot, we do not <hi>hence</hi> infer, that they were Canonical or Wrote by thoſe Apoſtles, whoſe Names they now bear; becauſe neither <hi>Clemens</hi> nor <hi>Ignatius</hi> tell us ſo, and therefore <hi>that</hi> muſt be Learn'd from other Authors. In like manner, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that <hi>Ignatius</hi> took the expreſſion we are now conſidering, from the Goſpel according to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> all we can gather from thence, is, that there was ſuch a Goſpel then extant, wherein that paſſage was Read. But that it was of Divine Authority, or Wrote by any of the Apoſtles, we cannot gather, for St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſays no ſuch thing; we muſt learn that, if it can be learn'd, from other Writers. Since then we allow as much Authority to this Father in one caſe, as we do to him or St. <hi>Clemens</hi> in the other, certainly our Author can deſire no more, and therefore I ſuppoſe we are agreed as to this matter.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:43789:62"/>
            <p>But
<note n="*" place="bottom">Whether what our Author produces out of <hi>Origen,</hi> as from <hi>Ignatius</hi> concerning <hi>the Devils being ignorant of the Virginity of the Virgin Mary, &amp;c.</hi> be deſigned as an Objection againſt the genuineneſs of that Epiſtle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe Expreſſions are found, or no, I cannot tell.

                  </gap>o..</note> perhaps it may be Objected, that if we grant this, we grant that St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> quoted a Spurious Goſpel. To this I anſwer, (1.) That the queſtion before us at preſent, is not, whether this Father quoted a Spurious Goſpel or no, but whether, by borrowing a Paſſage after this manner, from the Goſpel according to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he advances it into the Canon. The contrary to which I have plainly prov'd to be true. (2.) This Goſpel, with the additions, ought not to be look'd upon as Spurious or a Forgery, but rather as a Piece of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi> See above at the end of <hi>Section XVI.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we proceed to <hi>Hermas,</hi> it muſt be owned that he produces not one Text (that we can be ſure of) out of either the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> but quotes one ſhort Sentence out of an <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Book, call'd the <hi>Propheſies of Eldad and Medad.</hi> And therefore ſince we make no manner of uſe of this Writer for the Eſtabliſhing the Canon, we cannot be oblig'd by our Authors Argument to embrace this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal</hi> Piece upon his Authority. Only I ſhall add, that the Paſſage is good and true, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſay'd it. <hi>The Lord is nigh unto all thoſe, who turn unto him;</hi> and therefore might be quoted,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43789:62"/>not upon the Authority of the Book, but the Intrinſick Value of the Expreſſion, which may be cited without danger, from the Mouth or Pen of the greateſt Impoſtor.</p>
            <p>And thus I have anſwer'd our Author's third difficulty, <hi>why all the Books, which are cited by Clemens and the reſt ſhould not be equally Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;</hi> and ſhown, that there is but <hi>one ſingle Piece,</hi> that we count Suppoſitious, <hi>quoted by Name,</hi> and that too, not referring to the time of the <hi>New</hi> but <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> and quoted it is by an Author of whoſe Teſtimony we make no uſe in ſettling the Canon, and therefore we cannot be tied and bound by it in the caſe of this pretended Prophecy; neither indeed ought any one elſe. For he is alone in the matter (as far as appears at preſent,) and contradicts the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, who knew nothing of this Book nor ever admitted it among their Canonical Writings. As for the Paſſage of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> pretended to be borrowed from the Goſpel according to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> I hope, what has been above-ſay'd, is ſatisfactory; and for the reſt, in him and <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when our Author ſhall pleaſe to tell us, <hi>whence they were fetch'd, and under what notion they are quoted,</hi> he ſhall hear more of my mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polycarp</hi> has not one Paſſage out of any Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or unknown Writer that I can find, and therefore I ſuppoſe he may be diſmiſs'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further trouble.</p>

<hi>Barnabas,</hi> becauſe I am not concern'd, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whether it be Genuine or no. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that he deſigns to improve the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion he fetches thence to the Prejudice of the Chriſtian Religion, I thought my ſelf oblig'd to add a few lines upon that occaſion: The Words in the Original are thus, Chriſt <hi>choſe for his Apoſtles — thoſe who were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Sinners, that he might ſhow, how he came to call, not the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> We have little or no account in the Scripture of the Apoſtles Morals, before they were choſen by our Saviour, and therefore we'll, for the preſent, let this Paſſage of <hi>Barnabas</hi> go for true. What will follow? Nothing elſe, as far as I ſee, but that our Lord was an Excellent Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of Souls, who wrought ſo perfect and Effectual a cure upon Men in ſuch a dangerous condition, and brought them to a true Senſe of Piety and Religion, for the Encouragement of others to Repent and Reform. Ay, but if they were once ſuch,
<note n="(g)" place="margin">

               <hi>this would Rob us of an Argument, we draw from their Integrity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, againſt Infidels.</hi> Would it ſo indeed? Methinks now this is very ſtrange, and does not conclude ſo well, as the Argument of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> from the four Winds, with which we ſee what a ſtir our Author made, a little before. For may not a Wicked Man prove good, and may he not give us ſuch Evidences of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his Reformation, that we are bound in Juſtice to believe him? Let us examine the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43789:66"/>caſe a little, and ſee what Arguments can be produc'd for the unrightneſs and integrity of the Apoſtles after their Converſion. They Preach'd a moſt Excellent and Holy Religion over all the World, and endeavour'd to bring People every where to the Belief and Practice of it. And that they were in good earneſt in all their undertakings, and did not act a part for carrying on any Worldly deſign, is appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from hence, that they <hi>knowingly and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> expos'd themſelves to Pains, to Troubles, to Loſſes, to Contempt, to Perſecutions, to Torments, to Death it ſelf. This, I think, is ſufficient to ſhow, that they really believ'd what they affirm'd, concerning the Doctrine, Works and Reſurrection of our Saviour; that they did not deſign to put a Trick upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the Relations, they gave thereof, ſince they readily expos'd themſelves to ſuch Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the aſſerting of it. And that they aſſerted nothing but what was true, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did alſo further atteſt, by the Miracles he enabled them to work, of which we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable proof, as has been ſo often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by others that I need not to inſiſt upon it here. So that though we do ſuppoſe the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> to be Genuine, and the Paſſage quoted from it to be really true, yet it is plain nothing can be thence inferr'd to prove our Religion falſe or ill grounded.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXV"/> Having thus given a large account of the Teſtimony which theſe two very Ancient Writers of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> give to the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> I ſhall now paſs on to remark, before I conclude, what Opinion an Eminent <hi>Heathen,</hi> even <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> (that bitter and inveterate Enemy of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity) entertain'd concerning them. This we may eaſily learn from what he Wrote and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd againſt our Holy Religion; which may be ſeen in Mr. <hi>Spanheim</hi>'s Edition of his Works, wherein St. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Anſwer to the Books of that Emperour, with what remains of the Books themſelves, againſt the Chriſtians is Printed, as it is alſo in <hi>Cyril</hi>'s own Works.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43789:71"/>There we ſhall find, that <hi>Julian</hi> expreſly mentions the Writings of
<note n="(h)" place="margin">
                  <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 327.</note> the Four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts by Name, of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> as their own proper and undoubted Works; that he ſpeaks

<note n="(o)" place="margin">
                  <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 245.</note> out of the Firſt to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and diſputes againſt them. To which may be added, that he ſpeaks of the Writings of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
               <note n="(p)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 42. <hi>p.</hi> 423.</note> alſo in his Epiſtles.</p>
            <p>The Inferences, which naturally ariſe from hence, are theſe two, Firſt, that it was well known among the Heathens, that the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> as embrac'd by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, were the Records, upon which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion was founded; and accordingly <hi>Julian</hi> ſets himſelf directly to oppoſe, what was delivered in them, as the moſt ready way to overthrow and ruin Chriſtianity. Secondly, That there was then no Reaſon known, why the Books ſhould be ſuſpected, as not really Wrote by thoſe Perſons, to whom we aſcribe them, or why they ſhould be judg'd to have been chang'd and alter'd by the Catholicks. For if there had been the leaſt probable ground for ſuch an accuſation, we may be ſure, this Learned and keen Adverſary of theirs would not have forgot to lay it to their charge; he would never have cited the Books, as the Genuine Works of St. <hi>John</hi> St. <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi> but
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43789:71"/>affirm'd plainly they were the Forgeries and Contrivances of later times, drawn up, by he knew not whom, to advance the Credit and Reputation of their Maſter. Since therefore he does nothing of this, but the quite contrary; ſince he quotes theſe Pieces as the Writings of the Apoſtles and Apoſtolick Men, and never accuſes the Chriſtians of Falſifications or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, we may be certain that he knew of nothing, which could be juſtly objected againſt them, as to this Particular.</p>
            <p>I would offer the ſerious conſideration of this Inſtance to the <hi>mighty diſcoverers</hi> of the preſent Age. We have here an Emperour, who wanted neither Learning, nor Wit, nor Induſtry, inflam'd with a moſt eager deſire of running down Chriſtianity; aſſiſted therein, not only with the Writings of <hi>Celſus, Porphyry, Hierocles,</hi> and others, who had engag'd in the ſame cauſe before him; but alſo with the beſt advice and directions (we may be ſure) of <hi>Libanius, Jamblichus, Maximus,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Sophiſts</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who flouriſh'd in his time; who yet, with all theſe helps, could find no ſolid Grounds or Reaſons for repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> as a Forgery. So far was he from pretending thereto, that, on the contrary, he owns the Books thereof, which he had occaſion to mention, for the Genuine Works of thoſe Perſons, to whom we attribute them at preſent, and does not any where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his ſuſpicions, that either they, or any of the reſt, were either forg'd or corrupted by the Catholicks. Whereas there are thoſe in our
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43789:72"/>days, who, above Thirteen Hundred years after him, pretend to diſcover that, which neither he, nor any of the Learned aſſerters of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm (who doubtleſs ſupplied him, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, with their moſt Curious and Critical Remarks and Obſervations) could do; and bear the World in hand, that thoſe Ancient Monuments of our Faith, which are aſcrib'd to the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, are none of theirs, but the Impoſtures and Contrivances of deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, who have impos'd them upon the Credulous and unthinking part of Mankind. As if <hi>they</hi> had greater means and opportunities of diſcovering the Forgery at this diſtance (if there was one) then <hi>Julian</hi> and the zealous maintainers of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion had ſo long ago; or as if all the Chriſtian World, for ſo many Centuries, (except themſelves and a few more,) had been deſtitute of Integrity and Underſtanding. But whether the <hi>weakneſs</hi> or <hi>confidence</hi> of ſuch pretences be greater, I ſhall leave the Reader to determine.</p>
